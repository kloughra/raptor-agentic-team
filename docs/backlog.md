# Backlog

## Ready (prioritized, next sprint)
- hotfix-workflow-tool: Add a `run_hotfix` MCP tool that enforces a lightweight SDLC: create hotfix branch → implement + test → PR → user approval → merge. Tracked in sprint state like a mini-sprint. Prevents untracked code changes.
- pre-flight-branch-check: Before any agent writes code, verify it's on a tracked branch (sprint or hotfix). If on main, refuse to proceed and prompt for branch creation. Enforced in `spawnAgent` and runner loop.
- change-proposal-tool: Add a `propose_change` MCP tool that creates a backlog entry and routes to the correct workflow (sprint vs hotfix) based on scope. Forces all changes through tracking before any code is written.
- resource-aware-agent-scheduling: Add concurrency limits to parallel agent execution. Cap parallelism (e.g., max 2 agents) or detect CPU contention and queue excess agents
- checkpoint-resume-for-subagents: Pre-summarize completed discovery work so retries skip re-reading all specs and jump straight to generation
